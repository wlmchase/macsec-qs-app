# Quantum-Safe Messaging Application

## Objective

Our project aimed to establish a quantum-safe messaging application focusing on cryptographically secure algorithms.

### Skills Learned

- Public and Private Key Cryptography
- Quantum safe algorithms Key Exchange Mechanism (KEM)

### Tools Used

- Open Quantum Safe library
- Python

## To succesfully run the code:

    - liboqs needs to be installed
    - python-liboqs needs to be installed
    - the cryptography python library needs to be install


### For the simple scenario:


Launch the server.py first in one terminal, then launch client.py in another terminal


### For the client via server scenario:

Launch the central_server.py in a terminal
Then launch client_via_server.py in a new terminal
Launch yet another client_via_server.py in another new terminal


If further clients are needed, launch more client_via_server.py in new terminals
