# Quantum-Safe Messaging Application

## Objective

Our project aimed to establish a quantum-safe messaging application focusing on cryptographically secure algorithms.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- Open Quantum Safe library

## Steps


## To succesfully run the code:

    - liboqs needs to be installed
    - python-liboqs needs to be installed
    - the cryptography python library needs to be install


### For the simple scenario:


Launch the server.py first in one terminal, then launch client.py in another terminal


### For the client via server scenario:

Launch the central_server.py in a terminal
Then launch client_via_server.py in a new terminal
Launch yet another client_via_server.py in another new terminal


If further clients are needed, launch more client_via_server.py in new terminals
